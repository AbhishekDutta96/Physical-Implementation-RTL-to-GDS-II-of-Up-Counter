# Physical-Implementation-RTL-to-GDS-II-of-Up-Counter

1. Define the counter functionality and write RTL code using a hardware description language (Verilog or VHDL).
Functional Verification:

2. Simulate the RTL code using Cadence Incisive or other simulation tools for functional verification.
Synthesis:

3. Use Cadence Genus for logic synthesis to convert RTL to a gate-level netlist.
Floorplanning:

4. Use Cadence Innovus or Encounter to perform floorplanning, specifying the core and periphery areas, power grid, and I/O locations.
Placement:

5. Cadence Innovus or Encounter can be used for placement to determine the location of each cell on the chip.
Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):

6. Utilize Cadence Innovus or Encounter for clock tree synthesis to build an optimized clock distribution network.
Routing:

7. Cadence Innovus or Encounter tools can be employed for routing, connecting the placed cells with metal interconnects.
Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS):

8. Use Cadence Virtuoso to perform DRC and LVS checks on the layout to ensure it adheres to foundry rules and matches the schematic.
Timing Analysis:

9. Perform static timing analysis using Cadence Tempus or other tools to verify that the design meets timing requirements.
Extraction:

10. Use Cadence Quantus or other extraction tools to extract parasitic information and refine the timing analysis.
Physical Verification:

11. Run DRC and LVS checks again to ensure the final layout adheres to manufacturing rules.
